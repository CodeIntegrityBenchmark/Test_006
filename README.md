# Test_006
This project is part of a benchmark / test suite used to check the different git histories created through different development processes.
The test suite is meant to be processed by [SPHA-Code-Integrity](https://github.com/fraunhofer-iem/SPHA-Code-Integrity).

## Textual description
Expected commits that are against integrity rules: 
* initial commit
* commit directly done to main after first branch

create first feature branch, make a commit direclty to main, make a lot of commits to the feature branch. merge (merge commit) branch back to main.
